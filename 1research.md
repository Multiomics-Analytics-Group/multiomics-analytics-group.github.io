# Projects

## Knowledge Graphs

**Building High-quality Knowledge Graphs.** Using and developing Knowledge Graph technologies and methods to structured data and to connect them to knowledge to facilitate analysis and interpretation. We contribute to a groundbreaking field by developing tools and methods to build, assess and investigate these graph structures and apply them to solve challenges in biology and health.

## Machine Learning on Graphs


## Microbial Communities

**Exploring microbial communities and their environments.** Integrating multiple biological resources to unravel the assembly, interaction and adaptation mechanisms of microbial networks, offering insights into their functions and inpact on ecosystems, and how changes affect those communities.

## Multimodal Data

**Developing tools to process, integrate, and analyse multimodal data.** Diving into the benefits of harmonising multimodal data that converge to provide a comprehensive view of complex biological systems. Specifically we are interested in high-throughput multi-omics data generated using Mass spectrometry technology (proteomics and metabolomics) and metaomics data (metagenomics and metaproteomics).
