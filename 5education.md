The Multi-omics Network Analytics group and the Data Science Platform at [DTU Biosustain](https://www.biosustain.dtu.dk/) have come together to offer a diverse range of courses designed to empower students with essential data science skills and familiarize them with both internal and external tools we have developed.

We are strong advocates of open science, and as part of that commitment, we make sure to share all the course materials on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Multiomics-Analytics-Group). This means that you will have access to comprehensive resources that aim to enhance the learning experience.

Our courses are designed typically following a short-training format, ranging from single lectures to a few days of intensive, hands-on instruction. Explore our course offerings and contribute or provide feedback!
